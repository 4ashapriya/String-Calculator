## String-Calculator Requirements


1.	Create a simple String calculator with a method int Add(string numbers) 
a)	The method will return the sum of comma-separated integer numbers parsed from the numbers parameter (for an empty string it will return 0). Examples for the numbers parameter are: “” or “1” or “1,2”
b)	The Add method should handle an unknown amount of numbers
2.	In addition to commas, allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers.
a)	the following input is ok:  “1\n2,3” (will equal 6)
b)	the following input is NOT ok: “1,\n”
3.	As well as comma-separated and new lines, allow the Add method to support different delimiters
a)	To set the delimiter, the beginning of the input string will contain a separate line that looks like this: “//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]” for example “//;\n1;2” should return 3 where the default delimiter is ‘;’.
b)	the first line is optional. all existing scenarios should still be supported.
4.	The Add method when called with a negative number will throw an exception “negatives not allowed”. The exception string should include a comma-separated list of each negative number passed to the Add method. 
5.	The Add method should ignore any numbers bigger than 1000, so adding 2 + 1001 = 2
6.	Allow the Add method to support Delimiters of any length with the following format: “//[delimiter]\n” for example: “//[***]\n1***2***3” should return 6.
7.	In addition to point 6, allow the Add method to support multiple delimiters like this: “//[delim1][delim2]\n” for example “//[*][%]\n1*2%3” should return 6.
8.	In addition to point 7, allow the Add method to support multiple delimiters of any length like this:
“//[delim1][delim2]\n” for example “//[**][%%%]\n1**2%%%3” should return 6.
